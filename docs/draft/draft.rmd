# The Stone-Weierstrass Theorem
\textit{The Stone-Weierstrass theorem} states that, given an unitial subalgebra of $M$, $M_0$ that is 
closed under lattice operations and separates points, $\bar{M_0} = M$, and we say $M_0$ is dense in $M$.

# Trigonometric Polynomials

Similarly to normal polynomials, we can deduce that trigonometric polynomials are dense in bounded continuous functions on 
$[0, 2\pi]$ where trigonometric polynomials are functions of the form
$$f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^n a_n \cos(nx) + b_n \sin(nx)$$
By considering the identities of multiplication between trigonometric functions, we can easily see 
that the trigonometric polynomials form a unitial subalgebra that seperates points, and therefore dense by 
Stone-Weierstrass.
